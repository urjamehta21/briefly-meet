Teletext has come out dated due to the popular app. Popular app TV internet. Remote control should only be used for the TV due for a time to market and possibly also cost issues. Also key is the corporate image to stay recognizable. Your color and slogan, of course, is down at the bottom there. Now, just to say quickly, I would have thought that only being used for the television, the macro facility may now not be required. Or its functionality would have been of limited use to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. If anybody disagrees, we can definitely say so. And hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everyone going. I'd like to, if it's possible, hear from our marketing expert first to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go. So I'll just load up here presentation from here if you want. Would you like to start from here? Here's the... Um, try second one maybe. Try it? Yeah, I'll say it. Yeah, okay. Oh, put up with it in my last name, I guess not. But if you want me to just cycle through it for you or... Oh, yeah, that would be fine. Okay, functional requirement by me, Ebeneza. Okay. Okay, so we did some research. We asked 100 people their opinions on remote controls. We asked some open-ended questions. Just what are your opinions on the remote control? Got a lot of responses. And we asked some very specific questions and we got a lot of good feedback. Please bear in mind this is only 100 people. So even when the groups are divided into 15 to 25, 25 to 35, there's only maybe 10 people, 15 people in each group. Okay. So we got some of the best stuff we got. Remotes are often lost. I often lose my remote control to back at the couch, some place. And even if it's not lost permanently, it takes me a few minutes to find it. Most buttons are not used anymore. Like you said, tele-tex is outdated now. I remember trying to load a DVD player recently. And there were so many buttons. It took me, I don't know, maybe 10 minutes to go through each button because you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons. You know, there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. And if they do not very often, it takes too long to master the remote control. I've seen some remote controls that are big. So the buttons, you have to hold down more than one K at one time to do something. They're just not great to use. We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls. People do not like remote controls. Some of the good stuff we got. Between the age of 15 and 25, most people will be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. I don't get excited, I've got more to say on that. Most people will be willing to pay for that. Most people want remote controls to be pretty. They want it to be fancy. They want it to be different. Everybody has a white remote control with black buttons and a red button and a green button. Not everybody wants that. Finally, my opinion. The voice recognition thing is cool. And voice recognition, the software, open source software, exists already. It's a bit sketchy at sometimes. But we're going to get good, always accurate results. But for a very fixed number of words, how many different words can you have for a remote control up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven? How many, you can't have that many words for a fixed vocabulary. It works quite well. I'm pretty sure people will buy it. But after a while, people may want to return it. Because if you have to say, I mean, most people use a remote control for switching to channels. And they say they do that about 98% of your time using the remote control 98% of the time for changing channels. And that's for flickering through channels. So if you have to say, if you have to do that, what would the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it. However, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development. But this doesn't mean the need for microphones in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of. See, you get the two options. Even if you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for like nighttime, if you want to be watching television, you might be quiet. Or I don't know, you have a visitor come round and the remote is only trained for you. It's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and the regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part. Then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, because there are no restrictions on physical size or shape. It could be as fancy as you want it to be. It could be like a lollipop, something like that, something weird like that. As long as the voice recognition stuff works, that's fine. So we have the free birds, we have the design bit, we have the fancy bit, right? The voice recognition is fancy, it's cool, it's different, it's radical. And then we have an extra bit, I don't remember. So I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control? I think it's a big question. What people will be willing to wait for the period that it will take to train the remote? Because I think it will, the remote will get better over time with the same user, but for the first week or the first two weeks, are you willing to wait? Are you willing to have a bad remote control? And what if you have visitors come around? They stay the night, they want to use the TV. They can't use the remote because they speak differently to you. How do you account for regional accents and stuff like that? Will people return the remote control? I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control if they have the money. So do our audience have the money? But will they return it after a while? Because it's not as fast as pressing the button, it's not as practical. So do you think we should consider, I think it's cool? He could speak up for that, yeah? I'm sorry? If he could, he'd be up for that. Sure, I'm about to end. I think it's cool, but they definitely some considerations. Excellent, right? Here from the user interface designer, I think, might be an idea. Okay. You've got your presentation now. Is it on the... Yeah, actually, it's in the photo, yeah. Is it on the information? There was a... Whoops. Right here. Technical functions. Yeah, I started making stuff up. Feel like we're at Mimos. Okay. Okay, this is a brief run through the technical functions of the remote. The presentation is already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would be being able to control multiple devices, but there's still stuff of relevance. Okay. Press on. Yeah, I've looked at a couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. And it wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say. So this is more of a springboard for how these could be improved on. Basically, the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case, this television set, to say you're getting off your backside. And there's two main trends in the design practice on the one hand. And this particularly relates to sort of earliest models where it was, you know, so many buttons on it is about the size of the television set. And every possible function that the device has, the remote control controls, and most of these functions are not going to be used. It creates a rather user unfriendly interface. And in the end, there's a user-focused approach that pairs things down to just what is most likely to get used. And of course, there is a certain amount of loss of function here obviously, but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions. And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use. And for the most part, for TV remote, that would be channel control and volume. And if you are one can cooperate to control a DVD or BC Apple, into that, and there's a play pass stop, rewind, fast-forward, card, etc. My only use that we should definitely be going for a user-focused design. But I think the problem with a lot of the user-focused designs that are about is that they make assumptions and advance about what a given user is going to want to do most. So something that's more programmable, perhaps has the full range of functions available to it, but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. So those are the enemy accessible through fairly minimal number of controls. I like having this idea, including a joystick in that, and possibly a fairly minimal number of function buttons. You then have some sort of basic display on it, so if you're... But it changes in different modes for the device, it'll tell you just exactly what each direction of the joystick is going to do. What each function button is going to do. This is actually... I guess I'll be taking inspiration of games controllers, and the PlayStation controller, where you have four basic function buttons. They're just marked with distinctive geometrical shapes, and then dependent on what you're doing with it, what games. Those functions are further specified, so it's taken, taken away from that. Okay. Yep. Right. If we could hear from our industrial engineer, I guess I know. I'm still working on some vanguards finished. I... I'm not going to save on... Where do I have to save? If you look in the desktop, you'll find that there's a link to the project folder, or project documents. If you save it in there, we can open it up from here. Put it down there, so... Shit. And... Are you finding it okay? You just have to close it, then I don't know where I saved it. I like if you go to one, or whichever one you want to do, then just go to the save. All right. Okay. Right, I'm responsible for working design. This is basically the inside going on of the remote control, so you have the energy source. You have the user interface. This is what I've seen. The sender will push the button, the chip will respond, and then the digital signal sent to the TV. So... If you go to the next slide, you'll see... You'll see what do we need on the user interface. Do we need many buttons? Or do we need many light bulbs that could be easier to... to realize which appliances are on or not, or without taking too much power, or we need more components in there to split the power. The joystick is another thing if we're going to add that. There'll be more components to deal with that. So... We need to... I don't know exactly what... It's just a design of the layout of the electronic design. But I'll see there'll be more details once we decide what we're going to use our interface. Okay, so that will be decided, I guess. In the next slide... All right, yeah. If you go to the next slide, then, I just used the... It was a mess. I was just putting... I think it's at the end there. Don't worry about it, I told you. So, you have the energy source, obviously connected to the chip, and the user interface obviously contains everything. If the switch turns it on, Interrupt bulb will contact the TV and... you'll have whatever device or DVD player, bulb will turn on, say it's on. Do we need, on the control, different buttons to decide our different light bulbs? It'll be easier. I don't know what we should decide on that. Okay, well... Oh, sorry. I'm interrupting the... No, it's fidgety. Yeah. Okay. All right. We can probably skip that for now. So, we've had some stuff put forward, along with the new user requirements. We've had a lot of input, I'd say so far. I hear what the marketing expert's saying about voice-activated control. However, I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required, and the ability to cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause this issues. For example, you see that there's fairly robust services on computers via voice, IBM due, drag and dictate. But these require a lot of memory and usually state quite advanced processor requirements. Voice activation could be an interesting idea, but I think that our industrial designer would probably, upon some research, say that it's maybe not feasible. Okay. That's just my view right now. However, the idea of a joystick, and then maybe an LCD, which has been kind of put forward so far, it's almost like having a small... Not TV, to say, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from display, I don't know how much power now, CD would take, but it might be quite low. As if you're under a mouse, just telling you what's on, or... But literally... If you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than Bose's on a mobile phone, something where you can read an... Fair amount of information traversed maybe quite a few menus. If we maybe used mobile phones as a good example, we usually incorporate the keypad, and then every other functionality is usually associated inside of the traversing around. That could be one possibility. And then we could have, like, say, the common buttons, as you say, volume control, changing channels. I think the remote... The default functions for the joystick could be up and down for volume-lessing-life channels. We think that people who've got mixed up, like, they'd be looking at this screen, they're not screened. You know, I'm trying to get everything working, would it be the confusing? I think, probably, for the first couple of hours of using it. Yeah. But, you know, muscle memory is a wonderful thing. I think that size of display was about what I had in mind. Though, I would say, you're probably... probably required to... Most of the mobile phones display you see these days, color books should probably kind of stick to black and white. I would... It's simply to keep the unit cast down. Color could be either subsequent development but cost a bit of extra money. But once everyone's got the first... Oh, colors out the last three days. That would be my feeling as well. I think we could possibly create quite useful user interface. Sorry, go for it. The idea of a remote with a menu and the joystick, I think, like, if I was in a habit of buying remote controls, then I would want one. But I think we don't have a specific audience. What is our target audience? What nature... Me, shall we try to mark it in corner? You know what I'm saying? For whom is this intended? Everybody? I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used the mobile. And that might be just another way of saying, trying to target most people. If we were to follow that avenue, we might be... We're kind of relying on their experience with a mobile phone, I suppose. But that does cover a very large section of the people out there. I think that's true. I imagine as well that the actual LCD, and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well, would be for the additional functionality, which maybe doesn't get used as often. Maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it. And you can still have the main buttons that allow people to turn the machine on and off. Up and down, it depends. Maybe we have the joystick as a separate one for the other functions. And there's just a small number of, as you were saying, buttons have already been defined. So like we go for the nice standard, up and down, and volume control. So that literally anybody can come along, pick up the remote, and still know what to do. And they can completely ignore most of the functionality, which would be for, say, the actual owner of the key V end, who would normally use the unit. I don't know. The thing I like about the joystick is that you then basically... I mean, for a TV remote alone, you could put... I mean, the main thing people do with a TV alone is the volume of the channel. You can pack all that onto a single control. But then, obviously, if you want to access further functions, you then get sort of menu navigation. I mean, with things like tuning in channels, adjusting brightness and fiddly things that no one would bother with. Most TVs these days actually have menus anyway. So this would be a fairly rational way of integrating the remote with the device is controlling. Do I know the difference? Do I have a concern about a market? If we are... I mean, most of the replacement remote market is... sort of remote control rationalization. You've got 20 different devices. You want one... You want one that will do the job of all of them. If all you are replacing is one of the... however many, the most you have in your living room, you still need separate remote for everything else. Well, this is a requirement that we have to stick to on a 3. This isn't one that I just arbitrarily decided on. So this is one of the solid ones that has to be evaded for now. So I can understand your point and I would agree with you. This is our design spec for now. Great to say. Does that... would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? Yeah. I would say so, yes, because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes. And that is a separate unit. I think that I would say that the design spec we've been laid with is for the television only for now. And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that. Okay, so we'll tell you the reason. Maybe we'll hear differently. But... So the joystick is just for... ...differentness. The ease of manipulation of certain functions, yes. Just a thumb. Maybe then our market should be TV manufacturers from the public. So it could then supply with... There is that possibility, yes. However, I don't know exactly where we will be going with that. But I might not even be the avenue for marketing it, but that might be sales, because we're not in this meeting. Is this the way I figure it? 12.5 euros per unit. We have to sell at least like 3 million, or something like that. Not to account for the money we waste the remote that no one buys. Like if we made a perfect... If we made a very remote we made someone board it. We have to set a lot of remote controls. Is this going to be enough to sell? Well, something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote which, as you said, you've done that. We've probably all done. I don't know if it's a gimmick or not, but if any of you have ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle, it will beep and you tell you where it is. I had one of those in my brother, my dad could have beat me up, because it went off all the time accidentally. Well, the other option, of course, is that... The clapping one. We... I was going to say clapping. Digital telephones. For example, one unit has... Of course, you have to have that base unit somewhere where there's a button, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the TV. For a further reason. When you press that, it would beep to give its location away on the remote unit. I think that could be something that could be... It's just a bit. And that way, because we're attaching what would be a small button to the TV, again, say what... It would be a small transmitter, watch battery type scenario, I'd say. Or something that if it was problems enough, you could actually even just... I don't know, power and elsewhere. That might be something that we could look into. Yeah. Yeah, it's putting a lot on your shoulders there. So, I mean, that could be something that separates this a bit from the market as well. Yeah. So... To go on from here. We have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. Before we leave this meeting, it'd be best to say, this is what we're going... This is the design we're going to try and get. This is how we're going to make ourselves look unique. Do we go for... Maybe a remote control... Sorry. We're going to go for remote control, obviously. Do we go for a small joystick that would operate, say, changing channels, up and down, and then, what, another button that would save it, it's now being used in the new around the LCD. Yeah. I just think volume should... Volume should be important in the joystick, do you think? We could use savey left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume. Yeah. And we have a frequency of how... What people use the remote control for most... Okay. Power is used, like, once per hour. Channel selection is used, 168 per hour. That's by far the biggest one. And then, tele-tix is stored here. Plus 14. Go. And volume selection. Volume selection, yeah. The tele-tix we're gambling with, and we're going to say... No. It's dead. Okay. Wave the door, though. Yeah. So we... Well, sorry. We could maybe even go as far as saying... Power button. Small joystick. LCD. And then, what? Maybe is it... One more button to save it. You're using the menu system. And the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say, okay. So we're having very, very few buttons involved. So navigation around a menu for most things. And so I would say... Two function buttons, they... We're now using the menus button. And... And then, okay, button. I mean, so something I found with joystick on... The joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time... The device mistakes. You've tried to move it in one direction or the other. But pushing down for, okay. Okay. And that's really irritating. The other design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are... You know, very much used to using a remote control one-handedly. So we need to make sure that even with the joystick, you know, something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand... ...have the joystick just control. Okay. So, I'd say that sounds like a rough idea. Do we incorporate the idea of trying to locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Yeah, I think so. I think because it's so small, it might be... I mean, if we only have like two of the buttons, it might be essential to have... To have... To locate it again. Yeah. So that would require a transmitter, maybe attached to the TV, just so they say, find me. And basically a small microphone on the actual unit can maybe hide it in the case. The light bulb as well, no? Sorry? A small speaker, you know? A speaker, sorry, yeah. Yeah. And a light bulb, no. To flash, no. Now you'd see it anyway. Here. We might be better with the sound possibly. Yeah, those little key rings have both. So... In true fact, considering the cost of an LED, you could just incorporate it anyway. Yeah. The LEDs can be surprisingly bright now. Yeah. The ones, particularly, plus that's a nice redesign. Yeah. So by the sense that what we're suggesting so far, your design... The user interface is still quite open. You could go for quite an interest in design. Because we're only going to have a very few keep... And you've got... You know, a small LCD joystick. I think it leaves you open to a potential wide range of shapes, something that can make it stand out slightly. If you could look into what we suggested so far, the feasibility of a small transmitter, and such, maybe if an LCD screen requires too much power or such, if an user... Mark and I can you expect? Well, I can give you the frequency. What people... What options people use most often, I guess, that's going to be important in defining the... The software side of the interface, right? You want the stuff that are more... Yeah. If you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken where of a joystick to control the very basic functions. Okay. And then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile. Okay. I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame, but could be something we could maybe look into. Sure. Sure. Okay. Any last comments anybody would like to put forward anything that you think has been missed out? A bit of a wide open questionnaire, of course. Okay. Feel free to email me if you think that we've screwed something up and want to get it rectified as soon as possible. Okay. Yeah. So I should just look at the speaker, about the speaker and LED. Speaker and LED for locating. Transmitter. Transmitter. What we thought about that. If we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers, then the... And the transmitter could actually be built into the television. We've just been getting external power source. Yeah. That's what it's like. And something that we can easily be adopted at the last minute as well as the electronics can be either placed externally or internally. Make sure the difference to the final product of the actual remote control. So that's good. Maybe gives us a new potential market. Yeah. I mean, if we get a major television manufacturer to say, oh yeah, we'll have that save us the bother. Then that's vast amounts of sales quite, quite a lot. Oh. One thing Roma has not talked about at all. My apologies for that. User interface. We also need to maybe get the slogan in here. It's... I'm pointing at my laptop. What the God. Real reaction. And such. So, um... As long as you put the fashion in electronics. My apologies. No, it could well be. I've probably missed that. So I think that's almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top. So I'm not too concerned that we haven't gone into depth about that. But it might be something you can consider when you're thinking about shapes. In fact, we might like to put a slogan on and possibly two hours to signify the company rather than a real reaction. I thought the double arc would perhaps be the end of that. Sounds good. And I'd say for that, such for now.
